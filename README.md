## Features

- This app is use to represent the rotation of Qbit in a Bloch sphere when is passed through different quantum gates.
- This can be very useful for learning basics of qbit and its rotation operation(or Dirac change) in real time.
- This is achieved through python Qiskit and Tkinter.
- Also it helps visualising change in qbits when it is passed through combination of quantum gates.
